The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

Abstract
We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we
survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains,
the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we
demonstrate convergence across data modalities:
as vision models and language models get larger,
they measure distance between datapoints in a
more and more alike way. We hypothesize that
this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato’s concept
of an ideal reality. We term such a representation
the platonic representation and discuss several
possible selective pressures toward it. Finally,
we discuss the implications of these trends, their
limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.

Neural networks, trained with different objectives on
different data and modalities, are converging to a shared
statistical model of reality in their representation spaces.

Figure 1. The Platonic Representation Hypothesis: Images (X)
and text (Y ) are projections of a common underlying reality (Z).
We conjecture that representation learning algorithms will converge on a shared representation of Z, and scaling model size, as
well as data and task diversity, drives this convergence.

1. Introduction
AI systems are rapidly evolving into highly multifunctional
entities. For example, whereas in the past we had specialpurpose solutions for different language processing tasks
(e.g., sentiment analysis, parsing, dialogue), modern large
language models (LLMs) are competent at all these tasks
using a single set of weights (Srivastava et al., 2022). Unified systems are also being built across data modalities:
instead of using a different architecture for processing images versus text, recent models, such as GPT4-V (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini (Google, 2023), and LLaVA (Liu et al.,
2023), handle both modalities with a combined architecture.
More and more systems are built off of general-purpose
pretrained backbones, sometimes called foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), that support a large range
of tasks, including robotics (Driess et al., 2023; Brohan
et al., 2023), bioinformatics (Ma et al., 2024), and health-

care (Steinberg et al., 2021). In short, AI systems are becoming increasingly homogeneous in both their architectures
and their capabilities.
This paper explores one aspect of this trend: representational
convergence. We argue that there is a growing similarity
in how datapoints are represented in different neural network models. This similarity spans across different model
architectures, training objectives, and even data modalities.
What has led to this convergence? Will it continue? And
ultimately, where does it end?
Our central hypothesis (position), stated above in Fig. 1,
is that there is indeed an endpoint to this convergence and
a principle that drives it: different models are all trying to
arrive at a representation of reality, meaning a representation of the joint distribution over events in the world that
generate the data we observe. Fig. 1 conveys this hypothesis: there exists a real world (labeled Z), which we measure
with various sensors, such as the camera shown to the left
(X). Other projections of these measurements, such as the

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

textual description shown, can be produced from the first set
of measurements or mediated by some other set of measurements, e.g., touch or other camera views (dotted arrow from
X to Y )1 . Representation learning algorithms find vector
embeddings that statistically model the various measurements and projections. The resulting vector embeddings
are all derived from the underlying reality in Z and thereby
become aligned. As models are trained on more data and for
more tasks, they require representations that capture more
and more information about Z, and hence alignment toward
Z increases toward a convergent point as a function of scale.

1950; Smola & Schölkopf, 1998). Following prior literature,
we define representational alignment as a measure of the
similarity of the similarity structures induced by two representations, i.e., a similarity metric over kernels. We give the
mathematical definition of these concepts below:

We call this converged hypothetical representation the “platonic representation” in reference to Plato’s Allegory of the
Cave (Plato, c. 375 BC), and his idea of an ideal reality
that underlies our sensations. The training data for our algorithms are shadows on the cave wall, yet, we hypothesize,
models are recovering ever better representations of the actual world outside the cave. This idea is not unique to Plato;
our hypothesis is also related to the notion of “convergent realism” (Newton-Smith, 1981; Putnam, 1982; Doppelt, 2007;
Hardin & Rosenberg, 1982) in the philosophy of science
(i.e., that science is converging on truth), and to many arguments that have been put forth in the representation learning literature (e.g., Tian et al. (2020a); Zimmermann et al.
(2021); Richens & Everitt (2024); Cao & Yamins (2024)).

• A kernel-alignment metric, m : K × K → R, measures
the similarity between two kernels, i.e., how similar is the
distance measure induced by one representation to the
distance measure induced by another. Examples include
Centered Kernel Distance (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019),
SVCCA (Raghu et al., 2017), and nearest-neighbor metrics (Klabunde et al., 2023).

• A representation is a function f : X → Rn that assigns
a feature vector to each input in some data domain X .
• A kernel, K : X × X → R, characterizes how a representation measures distance/similarity between datapoints.
K(xi , xj ) = ⟨f (xi ), f (xj )⟩, where ⟨ · , · ⟩ denotes inner
product, xi , xj ∈ X and K ∈ K.

In our experiments, we use a mutual nearest-neighbor metric that measures the mean intersection of the k-nearest
neighbor sets induced by two kernels, K1 and K2 , normalized by k. This metric is a variant of those proposed in Park
et al. (2024), Klabunde et al. (2023) and Oron et al. (2017).
See Appendix A for the exact definition and Appendix B
for comparisons with alternative alignment metrics.

Also closely related to our hypothesis is the “Anna Karenina
scenario” described by Bansal et al. (2021), referring to the
possibility that all well-performing neural nets represent the
world in the same way. We discuss the evidence they give
for this possibility in Sec. 22 . The platonic representation
hypothesis refers to the situation where we are in an Anna
Karenina scenario and the “happy representation” that is
converged upon is one that reflects a statistical model of the
underlying reality. We discuss the potential nature of this
statistical model in more detail in Sec. 4.

Next, we explore several ways in which representations are
converging. First, we argue that different neural networks
are converging to aligned representations. Then, we show
that this continues to hold across modalities, where image
embeddings in vision models align with text embeddings in
language models.
2.1. Different models, with different architectures and
objectives, can have aligned representations
One indication of representational convergence is the rising
number of systems built on top of pre-trained foundation
models. These models are becoming standard backbones
across a growing spectrum of tasks. Their versatility across
numerous applications implies a level of universality in the
way they represent data.

2. Representations are converging
Preliminaries We restrict our attention to representations
that are vector embeddings. We characterize such a representation by the similarity structure it induces, referred to
as its kernel. Kernels are commonly used to assess representations (Kornblith et al., 2019; Klabunde et al., 2023);
this can be justified by the fact that they capture the relative
structures among data samples, which are also the learning
signal for many machine learning algorithms (Aronszajn,

While this trend implies convergence toward a relatively
small set of foundation models, it does not imply that different foundation models will arrive at the same representation.
Yet that is what has been observed by several recent papers.

1

Lenc & Vedaldi (2015) conducted one such study, in which
they measured representational similarity through a technique called model stitching. Given two models, f and g,
each composed of multiple layers (f = f1 ◦ · · · ◦ fn , g =
g1 ◦ · · · ◦ gm ), an intermediate representation from f is integrated into g via a learned affine stitching layer h, resulting
in a new stitched model F = f1 ◦· · ·◦fk ◦h◦gk+1 ◦· · ·◦gm .

Touch could convey the shapes in this example but not the
colors. This is an important limitation to our hypothesis that we
discuss at several points in the paper: different sensors and views
might capture different information, which may limit their potential
to converge to identical representations.

Borrowed from Tolstoy (1877), similar analogies have been
made in other domains, such as the “Anna Karenina principle”
popularized by Diamond (1998) to explain animal domestication.

If F has good performance, it indicates that f and g have
compatible representations at layer k, up to the transform h.

Figure 2. VISION models converge as COMPETENCE increases: We measure alignment among 78 models using mutual nearestneighbors on Places-365 (Zhou et al., 2017), and
evaluate their performance on downstream tasks
from the Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark
(VTAB; Zhai et al. (2019)). LEFT: Models

performance) also have similar internal activations. With the
continuing trend of models scaling up, this suggests model
alignment will increase over time – we might expect that the
next generation of bigger, better models will be even more
aligned with each other.

In their study, Lenc & Vedaldi (2015) made two notable
findings: (1) A vision model trained on ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015) can be aligned with a model trained
on Places-365 (Zhou et al., 2017) while maintaining good
performance; (2) The early layers of these convolutional
networks are more interchangeable than later layers. The
first finding illustrates a level of data independence where
distinct image datasets lead to similar representations. The
second finding agrees with extensive research that oriented
Gabor-like filters are common in both artificial and biological vision systems. This suggests a convergence to a similar
initial layer of representation across various neural network
architectures (Olshausen & Field, 1996; Krizhevsky et al.,
2017). Bansal et al. (2021) expanded on the idea of model
stitching, showing that models trained using self-supervised
objectives align closely with their supervised counterparts.

We expand upon this observation by evaluating the transfer performance of 78 vision models. These models were
trained with varying architectures, training objectives, and
datasets (detailed in Appendix C.1). In Fig. 2 (left), we bin
these models based on their average transfer performance on
the VTAB dataset (Zhai et al., 2019), and then measure the
average kernel alignment of the models within each bin. The
results indicate that models with high transfer performance
form a tightly clustered set of representations, while models
with weak performance have more variable representations.
We further visualize this structure with UMAP (McInnes
et al., 2018) over models representation in Fig. 2 (right).
This suggests that models that are competent all represent
data in a similar way. Echoing Bansal et al. (2021) and
Tolstoy (1877), we might say: all strong models are alike,
each weak model is weak in its own way.

Moschella et al. (2022) further demonstrated the feasibility
of “zero-shot” model stitching without learning a stitching
layer. Despite the fact that different text models were trained
on different modalities, they found that the models often
embed data in remarkably similar ways. In particular, they
considered the kernel K defined by learned representations
and showed that K serves as a bridge between models,
allowing an encoder trained in one language, like English,
to work effectively with a decoder in another, like French.

The discussion so far indicates that various models are aligning toward a unified representation. But does the convergence extend to model weights? While models with different architectures might not have compatible weight spaces,
there exists ample evidence that models with the same architecture will often converge to the same basin of weights (Nagarajan & Kolter, 2019; Garipov et al., 2018; Lubana et al.,
2023). This holds even for models with different initializations, up to permutations over weight space (Ainsworth
et al., 2022). Because of this, it is possible to merge separately trained models of the same architecture, and achieve
some of the capabilities of all models in the mixture (Stoica
et al., 2023; Jordan et al., 2022; Wortsman et al., 2022).

Dravid et al. (2023) extended this idea to individual neurons,
and found “Rosetta Neurons” that are activated by the same
pattern across a range of vision models. Such neurons form a
common dictionary independently discovered by all models.
2.2. Alignment increases with scale and performance
Kornblith et al. (2019) and Roeder et al. (2021) observed
model alignment not only exists but also increases with
model scale and dataset size. On CIFAR-10 classification,
Krizhevsky et al. (2009) found that larger models exhibit
greater alignment with each other compared to smaller ones.
Theoretically, Balestriero & Baraniuk (2018) showed that
models with similar outputs (e.g., as a result of having high

2.3. Representations are converging across modalities
Do models trained on different data modalities also converge? Several works indicate that the answer is yes.
Merullo et al. (2022) extended model stitching to the crossmodal setting, finding that a single linear projection is suffi3

Figure 3. LANGUAGE and VISION models align: We measure alignment using mutual nearest-neighbor on the Wikipedia caption
dataset (WIT) (Srinivasan et al., 2021). The x-axis is the language model performance measured over 4M tokens from the OpenWebText
dataset (Gokaslan & Cohen, 2019) (see Appendix B for plots with model names). We measure performance using 1 − bits-per-byte,
where bits-per-byte normalizes the cross-entropy by the total bytes in the input text string. The results show a linear relationship
between language-vision alignment and language modeling score, where a general trend is that more capable language models align better
with more capable vision models. We find that CLIP models, which are trained with explicit language supervision, exhibit a higher level
of alignment. However, this alignment decreases after being fine-tuned on ImageNet classification (labeled CLIP (I12K ft)).

cient to stitch a vision model to an LLM and achieve good
performance on visual question answering and image captioning. Koh et al. (2023) showed that linear stitching can
also work in the opposite direction, aligning text inputs to
visual outputs. In fact, many recent language-vision models
stitch pre-trained language and vision models together. For
example, LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023) demonstrated state-ofthe-art results by projecting visual features into a language
model with a 2-layer MLP.

termine whether models are indeed learning an increasingly
modality-agnostic representation of the world. We sampled
a variety of models trained either solely on vision or solely
on language, and compared their representations as they
became larger and more competent over many tasks.
In Fig. 3, we assess alignment between a suite of language
models and vision models. So far we have only defined
alignment for two kernels defined over the same input space.
To measure cross-modal alignment, we use paired datasets
to bridge the two modalities. For vision and text, we use
the Wikipedia captions dataset {(xi , yi )}i (Srinivasan et al.,
2021), composed of images from Wikipedia (xi ) and their
corresponding captions (yi ). We then measure alignment
between a language model ftext and a vision model fimg as
the alignment of the two following kernels:

Other works show further kinds of evidence of cross-modal
synergy. OpenAI (2023) found that jointly training a language model with a vision model improves performance on
language tasks, compared to training the language model
on its own. Sorscher et al. (2022) show a setting in which
word embeddings of visual concept names can be isometrically mapped to image embeddings for those same concepts.
Sharma et al. (2024) probed the visual knowledge of LLMs
trained only on language data, by converting images into
code that an LLM can process. They found that LLMs have
rich knowledge of visual structures, to the extent that decent
visual representations can be trained on images generated
solely by querying an LLM to produce code and rendering
the response. In visual generation, LLMs show abilities
to augment captions with visual structures (e.g., bounding
boxes) and improve generation quality (Betker et al., 2023;
Lian et al., 2023a;b; Wu et al., 2023). Over other modalities, Ngo & Kim (2024) showed auditory models are also
roughly aligned with LLMs up to a linear transformation,
and Ng et al. (2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of using
pre-trained LLMs for facial motion prediction.

Kimg (i, j) = ⟨fimg (xi ), fimg (xj )⟩

(1)

Ktext (i, j) = ⟨ftext (yi ), ftext (yj )⟩.

Using this analysis, we find that the better an LLM is at
language modeling, the more it tends to aligns with vision
models, as shown in Fig. 3. The converse effect also holds:
the better a vision models is, the more it tends to align with
LLMs. See Appendix C.2 for more details.
2.4. Models are increasingly aligning to brains
Neural networks also show substantial alignment with biological representations in the brain (Yamins et al., 2014).
This commonality may be due to similarities in the task and
data constraints both systems are confronted with. Even
though the mediums may differ – silicon transistors versus biological neurons – the fundamental problem faced

We set out to address these claims in a broader scope to de4

visualize correlation between LLM alignment score to DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) and downstream task performance on

with radii proportional to the size of the model, and color-coded by
their rank order in language modeling scores (1−bits-per-byte).
We observe that models aligned more closely with vision also show
better performance on downstream language tasks. See Appendix F
for additional results on GSM8K (math) (Cobbe et al., 2021).

3.1. Convergence via Task Generality

by brains and machines is the same: efficiently extracting
and understanding the underlying structure in images, text,
sounds, etc. (Barlow et al., 1961; Olshausen & Field, 1997).
Sorscher et al. (2022) developed a theoretical framework
for how the efficient extraction of novel concepts occurs
for both the human visual system and deep networks. The
tasks that the human visual system has been honed to perform through evolution – like segmentation, detection, and
whole-image classification – are also the ones that we train
our neural nets to perform. Yamins et al. (2014) went as far
as to title their work in the spirit that performance over such
tasks implies brain alignment. Antonello & Huth (2024)
posited that it is less the particular task and more the generality of the representations that explain their alignment with
biological representations. Further, Conwell et al. (2022)
showed that training data plays a large role in alignment.
Psychophysical studies have also shown agreement between
how humans perceive visual similarity and how models
do, even when the models are trained on tasks, such as
self-supervised prediction, that are seemingly unrelated to
mimicking human perception (Zhang et al., 2018).

Each training datapoint and objective (task) places an additional constraint on the model. As data and tasks scale, the
volume of representations that satisfy these constraints must
proportionately grow smaller, as visualized in Fig. 5 (left)
and stated below:
The Multitask Scaling Hypothesis
There are fewer representations that are competent for
N tasks than there are for M < N tasks. As we train
more general models that solve more tasks at once, we
should expect fewer possible solutions.
This has been previously termed as the Contravariance principle by Cao & Yamins (2024), which states that the set of
solutions to an easy goal is large, while the set of solutions
to a challenging goal is comparatively smaller. Moreover,
we argue that this narrower solution set also generalizes
better. As data scales, models that optimize the empirical
risk Ex∼ dataset [L(f, x)] also improve on the population risk
Ex∼ reality [L(f, x)], and become better at capturing statistical structures of the true data generating process (reality).

2.5. Does alignment predict downstream performance?
If models are converging towards a more accurate representation of reality, we expect that alignment should correspond
to improved performance on downstream tasks. Figs. 4
and 13 support this hypothesis by showing improved performance on commonsense reasoning (Hellaswag; Zellers
et al. (2019)) and mathematical problem solving (GSM8K;
Cobbe et al. (2021)) as alignment improves.

Recent work has demonstrated a power law relationship
between data scale and model performance (Hestness et al.,
2017). This implies that with enough data (e.g., consisting
of the entire internet and all offline scientific measurements)
one ought to converge to a very small solution set with
irreducible error – the inherent epistemic uncertainty of the
world. As more models are trained on internet-scale data,
the set of solutions that satisfies all data constraints must
become relatively small.

3. Why are representations converging?
Modern machine learning models are generally trained to
minimize the empirical risk with possible implicit and/or
explicit regularization:

In addition to data-scaling, many modern representation
learning objectives L (f, x) directly optimize for multitask solving. Contrastive learning finds a distance structure
over data samples that optimizes many classification tasks
(Arora et al., 2019b; Wang & Isola, 2020; Tian et al., 2020b).
Masked Autoencoders (He et al., 2021) optimize randomly
sampled reconstruction tasks. In fact, autoregressive language modeling can also be seen as optimizing a diverse set
of tasks (Radford et al., 2019). Such multi-task objectives

Figure 5. Why are models converging?: We provide three potential driving forces of model convergence. LEFT: (Multitask Scaling
Hypothesis) Models trained with an increasing number of tasks are subjected to pressure to learn a representation that can solve all the
tasks. MIDDLE: (Simplicity Bias Hypothesis) Larger models have larger coverage of all possible ways to fit the same data. However,
the implicit simplicity biases of deep networks encourage larger models to find the simplest of these solutions. RIGHT: (Capacity
Hypothesis) If an optimal representation exists in function space, larger hypothesis spaces are more likely to cover it. As the models
become larger, they cover the optimum and converge to the same solution (marked by filled ⋆).

may be more effective than single-task ones (e.g., ImageNet
classification) due to the fact that they impose more task
constraints on the representation, leading to a smaller and
higher-quality solution space (Chen et al., 2020; He et al.,
2020; Radford et al., 2017; 2019).

The Simplicity Bias Hypothesis
Deep networks are biased toward finding simple fits
to the data, and the bigger the model, the stronger the
bias. Therefore, as models get bigger, we should expect
convergence to a smaller solution space.
1

3.2. Convergence via Model Capacity

Such simplicity bias could be coming from explicit regularization R(f ) commonly used in deep learning (e.g.,
weight decay and dropout). However, even in the absence
of external influences, deep networks naturally adhere to
Occam’s razor, implicitly favoring simple solutions that fit
the data (Solomonoff, 1964; Gunasekar et al., 2018; Arora
et al., 2019a; Valle-Perez et al., 2019; Huh et al., 2023; Dingle et al., 2018; Goldblum et al., 2023). Fig. 5 (middle)
visualizes how simplicity bias can drive convergence.

Suppose there is a globally optimal representation for standard learning objectives. Then, under sufficient data, scaling
a model (i.e., using larger function classes F ), as well as
improved optimization , should be more effective at finding better approximations to this optimum, as shown in
Fig. 5 (right). With the same training objective, larger models, even of different architectures, will thus tend to converge
toward this optimum. When different training objectives
share similar minimizers, larger models are better at finding
these minimizers, and will train to similar solutions over the
training tasks. We summarize this hypothesis as follows:

4. What representation are we converging to?
By now, we hope to have convinced the reader that task and
data pressures, combined with increasing model capacity,
can lead to convergence. We next turn our attention to what
exactly is the endpoint of all this convergence.

The Capacity Hypothesis
Bigger models are more likely to converge to a shared
representation than smaller models.

Our central hypothesis, stated in Fig. 1, is that the representation we are converging toward is a statistical model
of the underlying reality that generates our observations.
Consistent with the multitask scaling hypothesis, such a representation would naturally be useful toward many tasks (or
at least toward any task grounded in reality). Additionally,
this representation might be relatively simple, assuming that
scientists are correct in suggesting that the fundamental laws
of nature are indeed simple functions (Gell-Mann, 1995), in
line with the simplicity bias hypothesis.

3.3. Convergence via Simplicity Bias
Arriving at the same mapping on the training data does
not prohibit the models from developing distinct internal
representations. It is not unreasonable to posit that the representations used to detect a dog in a 1M parameter model
could be quite different than that used by a 1B parameter
model. What would stop a billion-parameter (and counting) model from learning an overly complicated and distinct
representation? One key factor might be simplicity bias:

But what exactly do we mean by “a statistical model of the
underlying reality.” In this section, we formalize one definition with concrete mathematical statements. Importantly,

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

this section should be read as just one concrete candidate
for the form of the platonic representation; other candidates
could be arrived at from other modeling assumptions.

the log odds ratio up to some offset:
P(pos | xa , xb )
+ c̃X (xa ) (3)
⟨fX (xa ), fX (xb )⟩ ≈ log
P(neg | xa , xb )
Pcoor (xa | xb )
= log
+ cX (xa ) (4)
Pcoor (xa )
= KPMI (xa , xb ) + cX (xa ),
(5)

4.1. An idealized world
We consider a world that works as follows, consistent with
the cartoon in Fig. 1. The world consists of a sequence of
T discrete events, denoted as Z ≜ [z1 , . . . , zT ], sampled
from some unknown distribution P(Z). Each event can be
observed in various ways. An observation is a bijective,
deterministic function obs : Z → · that maps events to an
arbitrary measurement space, such as pixels, sounds, mass,
force, torque, words, etc. Later, in Sec. 6, we discuss limitations and potential extensions to continuous and unbounded
worlds, and stochastic observations, that could yield a model
that better reflects real learning scenarios.

where KPMI is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) kernel, and cX (xa ) is constant in xb . We note that this is
a common setting for self-supervised contrastive learners
with NCE objectives (Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010; Oord
et al., 2018), including SimCLR (Chen et al., 2020) and
SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021). (See Oord et al. (2018) and
Appendix G.1 for detailed derivations.)
Under mild conditions that the world is smooth enough (see
Appendix G.2), a choice of fX can exactly represent KPMI :
⟨fX (xa ), fX (xb )⟩ = KPMI (xa , xb ) + cX ,

One can think of an event as corresponding to the state of
the world at some point in time3 , but it is also fine to simply
consider an event as any variable that indexes observations,
with no further physical meaning4 .

(6)

where we observed that cX (xa ) from Eq. (5) must be a
constant since both sides are symmetric.
Therefore, the contrastive learners we consider are minimized by a representation fX whose kernel is KPMI (up to
a constant offset). With sufficient data and optimization, we
will observe convergence to this point.

In this idealized world, knowing P(Z) would be useful for
many kinds of predictions; this would constitute a world
model over the events that cause our observations (Werbos,
1987; Ha & Schmidhuber, 2018; Richens & Everitt, 2024).
We will next show that a particular representation of P(Z)
is recovered by certain contrastive learners.

Thus we have convergence to a representation of the statistics of X, but what about Z? Recall that our idealized world
consists of bijective observation functions, which, over discrete random variables, preserve probabilities. So we have:

4.2. A family of contrastive learners converge to a
representation of P(Z)

Pcoor (xa , xb ) = Pcoor (za , zb ), KPMI (xa , xb ) = KPMI (za , zb ),

where we use Pcoor and KPMI modality-agnostically to emphasize that different modalities share these same quantities.

Consider a contrastive learner that models observations that
cooccur together. For simplicity, we ground our discussion
with the following definition of the cooccurrence probability, Pcoor , of two observations xa and xb both occurring
within some window Twindow :
X
Pcoor (xa , xb ) ∝
P(Xt = xa , Xt′ = xb ).

All these arguments hold not just for X but also for Y (or
any other bijective, discrete modality), implying:
KPMI (za , zb ) = ⟨fX (xa ), fX (xb )⟩ − cX
= ⟨fY (ya ), fY (yb )⟩ − cY .

Therefore, for any modality in our idealized world, we
observe representational convergence to the same kernel,
which represents certain pairwise statistics of P(Z).

Analogously, we can define Pcoor for Z and other observation modalities. Note that Pcoor is symmetric.
Consider positive pairs as two observations nearby in time
(sampled from Pcoor ) and negative pairs as observations
drawn from any point in time (sampled independently from
the marginal). Our contrastive learner tries to classify if
a pair is positive or negative by learning a representation
fX : X → Rd such that the dot-product kernel approximates

This analysis suggests that certain representation learning
algorithms may boil down to a simple rule: find an embedding in which similarity equals PMI. We note that this
idea is consistent with prior works that have used PMI as
a similarity measure for clustering in vision and language
(e.g., Isola et al. (2014); Isola (2015); Isola et al. (2016);
Chambers & Jurafsky (2008)).

Here we only analyze temporal sequences, but note that the
same could be done with respect to events laid out in space instead.

This latter interpretation may be more consistent with Plato’s
intent. Scholars have argued that his allegory of the cave rejects
any notion of a true world state (Nettleship, 1897). Instead, we
could say that the joint distribution of observation indices is itself
the platonic reality.

A study in color We conduct a case study to verify that
convergence does happen on real data. Abdou et al. (2021)
discovered that color distances in learned language representations, when trained to predict cooccurrences in text
(Devlin et al., 2018), closely mirror human perception of

these distances, which we reproduce in Fig. 6 with both contrastive and predictive models. Interestingly, they noted an
increasing similarity as models scale larger and become better at modeling text cooccurrences. In Fig. 6, we also learn
representations of color based on KPMI from cooccurrences
in images. Indeed, learning cooccurrence statistics in either
domain recovers roughly the same perceptual representation.
Details of this experiment are described in Appendix D.

OpenAI (2023) showed that training on images improved
performance on text. In theory, there should be some conversion ratio: a pixel is worth a words for training LLMs,
and a word is worth b pixels for training vision models.
Ease of translation and adaptation across modalities
When two representations are aligned, transitioning from
one to the other should be a simple function that’s easily obtained. Our hypothesis could explain the phenomenon that
conditional generation is easier than unconditional (Mirza &
Osindero, 2014; Liu et al., 2020; Sauer et al., 2022), as the
data we condition on may have the same platonic structure
as the data we are generating. In line with this, recent work
has found that representation-conditioning is even easier (Li
et al., 2023). Similarly, representational convergence could
act as a bridge that lets us find mappings between domains
even without paired data; this may underlie the success of
unpaired translation in vision (Zhu et al., 2017; Shi et al.,
2024; Xie et al., 2022) and language (Tran et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2018). We emphasize that this doesn’t mean that
models trained on a single modality (e.g., language) can
immediately process raw data from another (e.g., vision).
What makes them adaptable to the new modalities is that
they share a common modality-agnostic representation, and
can readily process representations of new modalities. Furthermore, this implies that language models would achieve
some notion of grounding in the visual domain even in the
absence of cross-modal data5 . The primary advantage of
cross-modal data could then simply be sample efficiency.

We believe our simple model encapsulates essential aspects
of complex real-world systems and offers a path toward
understanding the representation that models are converging
to a unified model that is proficient across various domains
and modalities, grounded in the statistical properties of the
underlying world. Sec. 6 elaborates some limitations.

5. What are the implications of convergence?
Scaling is sufficient, but not necessarily efficient Our
arguments are roughly in line with the claim that “scale is all
you need” to reach high levels of intelligence. We have argued that as resources are scaled (# parameters, # datapoints,
# flops), representations are converging, regardless of other
modeling choices and even data modality. Does this mean
that scale is all that matters? Not quite: different methods
can scale with different levels of efficiency (Hestness et al.,
2017; Kaplan et al., 2020), and successful methods must
still satisfy some general requirements (e.g., be a consistent
estimator, model pairwise statistics of P(Z)).
Training data can be shared across modalities Suppose you have access to N images and M sentences, and
want to learn the best representation. If there is indeed a
modality-agnostic platonic representation, then both image
and language data should help find it. The implication is
that if you want to train the best vision model, you should
train not just on N images but also on M sentences. This is
already becoming common practice (OpenAI, 2023; Radford et al., 2021). Many vision models are finetuned from
pre-trained LLMs. The other direction is less common, but
also is implied by our hypothesis: if you want to build the
best LLM, you should also train on image data. Indeed,

Scaling may reduce hallucination and bias A prominent shortcoming of current LLMs is their propensity to
hallucinate, or output false statements. If models are indeed
converging toward an accurate model of reality, and scale
powers this convergence, then we may expect hallucinations to decrease with scale. Of course, our hypothesis is
5

In 1688, William Molyneux asked if a person born blind, upon
gaining sight, could distinguish shapes by vision alone (Locke,
1690). Our arguments suggest they could not do so immediately,
but after some visual experience, they could easily map shapes
to their prior touch-based representations. Empirical data supports this, showing that congenitally blind children given sight can
quickly learn these abilities (Held et al., 2011).

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

Not all representations are presently converging Our
argument has mainly focused on two modalities: vision
and language. While we do expect other modalities will
follow similar trends, we have yet to see the same level of
convergence across all domains. For example, in robotics
there is not yet a standardized approach to representing
world states in the same way as there is for representing
images and text. One limitation lies in the hardware used in
robotics, which is often expensive and slow. This creates a
bottleneck in the quantity and diversity of training data.

conditioned on the training data for future models constituting a sufficiently lossless and diverse set of measurements.
This may not come to pass, but it is an implication of our
hypothesis worth pointing out. A similar argument can be
made about certain kinds of bias. It has been shown that
large models can exacerbate existing biases present in their
training data (Hall et al., 2022). Our hypothesis implies that,
while this may be true, we should expect larger models to
amplify bias less. This does not mean bias will be removed,
rather that the model’s biases will more accurately reflect
the data’s biases, rather than exacerbating them.

Sociological bias in producing AI models Researcher
bias and collective preferences within the AI community
have shaped the trajectory of model development. There
is often an explicit or implicit goal of designing AI systems that mimic human reasoning and performance, and
this could lead to convergence toward human-like representations even if other kinds of intelligence are in fact possible.
Additionally, the “hardware lottery” (Hooker, 2021) suggests that the success of AI models can also depend on the
compatibility of their design with available computational
architectures, further contributing to convergent trends.

6. Counterexamples and limitations
Different modalities may contain different information
What about the information that is unique to a given modality? Can language really describe the ineffable experience
of watching a total solar eclipse? Or, how could an image convey the a concept like “I believe in the freedom of
speech,” which is easy to write in English? Two different
models cannot converge to the same representation if they
have access to fundamentally different information.

Special-purpose intelligences might not converge Different intelligent systems can be designed to accomplish different tasks. For instance: A bioinformatics systems might
predict protein structure; an autonomous vehicle might follow lanes on highways. It’s possible that not much is shared
between these two narrow tasks. Our argument only holds
for intelligences that are optimized to perform well on many
tasks. We have argued that a representation of reality is
a structure that is useful across many tasks, but for any
special purpose there may be shortcuts, or even effective
representations detached from reality. Such shortcuts may
be more efficient and necessary for continued improvements
in specific domains. This will become more relevant if continued scaling comes up against boundary conditions around
resources like energy and compute.

More precisely, our mathematical argument in Sec. 4 only
strictly holds for bijective projections of Z, so that the information in all the projections is equivalent to the information
in the underlying world. This will not hold true for lossy
or stochastic observation functions. Nonetheless, similar arguments have been made theoretically and empirically that
cooccurrence relations are learned by practical contrastive
(Wang & Isola, 2020; Zimmermann et al., 2021) and predictive learners (Papyan et al., 2020; Roeder et al., 2021). Lu
et al. (2021) and Mirchandani et al. (2023) also showed that
models trained to autoregressively generate text also capture statistical relations in many other modalities, including
symbolic reasoning, vision, protein folding, and robotics.
A more nuanced version of our hypothesis will need to be
developed to handle the case of non-bijective observations
and abstract concepts. A starting point could be: different
models will converge to the same representation when the
input signals are sufficiently high information and the models are sufficiently high capacity; when they are not, the
lower-information representation will only align with the
higher-information one up to a level capped by the mutual
information between the input signals and by the capacity
of each model. This cap might or might not be practically
important. Popular representations like CLIP are explicitly
optimized to only capture the shared information between
vision and language, yet are highly successful on many pure
vision tasks. We perform a preliminary test of the effect of
information level in Fig. 12 (detailed in Appendix E), and
find that the more descriptive (higher information) a caption
is, the better its LLM representation aligns with the visual
representation of the corresponding image.

How do we measure alignment? We focused on one
particular alignment measure, mutual nearest-neighbor, in
our experiments, and cited experiments using several others.
However, there is active debate on the merits and deficiencies of all these ways of measuring alignment (Bansal et al.,
2021; Sucholutsky et al., 2023). We discuss our choice and
show results for other alignment metrics in Appendix A.
Lots left to explain We have shown results where different
models arrive at similar but not the same representations.
For example, in Fig. 3, alignment clearly increases but only
reaches a score of 0.16, according to our mutual nearestneighbor metric. The maximum theoretical value for this
metric is 1. Is a score of 0.16 indicative of strong alignment
with the remaining gap being “noise” or does it signify poor
alignment with major differences left to explain? We leave
this as an open question.

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

A. Mutual k-Nearest Neighbor Alignment Metric
For two models with representations f , g the mutual k-nearest neighbor metric measures the average overlap of their
respective nearest neighbor sets. In this section, we refer to this metric as mNN , which we will formally define below.
For cross-modal domains, define (xi , yi ) ∈ X as a sample from the data distribution X (e.g. image-caption dataset). For the
single domain alignment measurements, the samples are equivalent xi = yi (e.g., images for vision, and text for language).
Let {xi , yi }bi=1 be the corresponding mini-batch sampled from this data distribution. Then given two model representations
f and g the corresponding features are: ϕi = f (xi ) and ψi = f (yi ), where the collection of these features are denoted as
Φ = {ϕ1 , . . . , ϕb } and Ψ = {ψ1 , . . . , ψb }. Then for each feature pair (ϕi , ψi ), we compute the respective nearest neighbor
sets S(ϕi ) and S(ψj ).
dknn (ϕi , Φ \ ϕi ) = S(ϕi )

(9)

dknn (ψi , Ψ \ ψi ) = S(ψj )

(10)

where dknn returns the set of indices of its k-nearest neighbors. Then we measure its average intersection via
1
mNN (ϕi , ψi ) = |S(ϕi ) ∩ S(ψj )|
k
where | · | is the size of the intersection.

(11)

The choice to use mutual nearest-neighbors Our initial efforts to measure alignment with CKA revealed a very
weak trend of alignment between models, even when comparing models within their own modality. This has also been
observed by (Bansal et al., 2021), which had relied on alternative metrics such as model-stitching as it “reveals aspects of
representations that measures such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) cannot” (Bansal et al., 2021).
We chose to use nearest-neighbor as a metric, as methods like CKA has a very strict definition of alignment, which may not
fit our current needs. For instance, understanding the precise similarity between unrelated items, such as an orange and Bill
Gates, may not be critical.
Relationship between CKA and Mutual Nearest-Neighbors Let ϕi ∈ Rn and ψi ∈ Rm be vectorized features of two
models (e.g. language and vision models). Let Kij = κ(ϕi , ϕj ) and Lij = κ(ψi , ψj ) be the kernel matrices computed from
a dataset using some kernel-function κ. Using an inner-product kernel, the ij-th entry of the centered counterpart of these
Kernel matrices is:
K̄ij = ⟨ϕi , ϕj ⟩ − El [⟨ϕi , ϕl ⟩]

L̄ij = ⟨ψi , ψj ⟩ − El [⟨ψi , ψl ⟩]

(12)

Then, the cross-covariance of K and L is given by:
1
Trace(K̄L̄)
(13)
(n − 1)2
which serves as an empirical estimator of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (Gretton et al., 2005). The Centered
Kernel Alignment (CKA) (Kornblith et al., 2019) is then its normalized counterpart:
HSIC(K, L)
CKA(K, L) = p
(14)
HSIC(K, K)HSIC(L, L)
CKA measures the congruence between two random variables, with a maximum alignment of 1 and a minimum of 0. It is
invariant to isotropic scaling and offers a strict notion of alignment, measuring alignment across all samples. Hence, the
CKA score reflects the global similarities of the models. This can be illustrated by expanding the trace term in HSIC:
XX
Trace(K̄L̄) =
(⟨ϕi , ϕj ⟩ − El [⟨ϕi , ϕl ⟩]) (⟨ψi , ψj ⟩ − El [⟨ψi , ψl ⟩])
(15)
HSIC(K, L) =

i

j

One can modify the definition of alignment to restrict the cross-covariance measurement to samples considered to be nearest
neighbors of the current sample i. This emphasizes similarity over dissimilarity, biasing the measure toward local alignment:
XX
Alignknn (K, L) =
α(i, j) · (⟨ϕi , ϕj ⟩ − El [⟨ϕi , ϕl ⟩]) (⟨ψi , ψj ⟩ − El [⟨ψi , ψl ⟩])
(16)
i

where

j

α(i, j) = 1[ϕj ∈ knn(ϕi ) ∧ ψj ∈ knn(ψi ) ∧ i ̸= j]

(17)

Where α(i, j) is a scalar weighting that assigns 1 if j is a mutual nearest neighbors to both ϕi and ψi , and 0 otherwise.

Figure 7. Cross-modal alignment increases locally: Alignment trend when varying the top-k nearest neighbors in the CKNNA
metrics (Eqn. 18). We center alignment score to the smallest language model and divide the total trend by the standard deviation. When
k = 1024, we recover the original CKA metric, and when k < |X | it closely resembles the mutual nearest-neighbor metric mNN . Each
line represents the average of all LLM models for a specific k. As we decrease k, the alignment becomes more pronounced.

We refer to this metric as the Centered Kernel Nearest-Neighbor Alignment (CKNNA) metric. As the number of nearest
neighbors k → dim(K), we recover the original CKA metric.

CKNNA(K, L) = p

Alignknn (K, L)
Alignknn (K, K), Alignknn (L, L)

(18)

We can further relax the metric to treat the cross-covariance term identically across all nearest-neighbor samples. This is
equivalent to the assumption that all nearby samples have the same distance. This simplification leads us back to the mutual
nearest neighbor metric:
XX
α(i, j) · 1 = n · k · mNN (ϕi , ψi )
(19)
i

j

By equating these metrics, we analyze the changes in alignment between language and vision models as we vary the number
of neighbors k in Eqn. 18. In Figure 7, we compute the average alignment score across all LLM models. For each k, we
center the scores to the smallest vision model and divide by the standard deviation of the scores. We find that high values of
k show less conclusive alignment across tasks while decreasing k shows a coherent trend across both models and tasks. We
find that certain visual tasks, such as CLIP, exhibit global alignment, whereas methods like ImageNet-21k classification
show only local alignment. This observation suggests that cross-modal alignment occurs locally across most common visual
tasks, and global alignment may require additional language grounding, as done in the CLIP objective.

17

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

B. Consistency across various metrics
We describe the metrics in Table 8 and their corresponding properties. The symmetric property implies that the metric is
symmetric with respect to the data points d(x, y) = d(y, x). The global property means all samples are used to compute the
distance with respect to every sample. The ordinal property is when the ordering of the distance is taken into consideration.
For example, mutual nearest neighbor is not ordinal since the nearest neighbors {a, b, c} and {c, a, b} are treated equally.
The batchable property is a computational property that makes it feasible to compute in a reasonable time frame.
Vision-vision comparison In Fig. 9, we evaluate Spearman’s rank correlation among different metrics and hyperparameters
over 78 vision models (details in Appendix C.1). We find most metrics highly correlated with each other.
Cross-modal comparison We measure vision-language alignment using a range of alternative metrics. We visualize
the corresponding alignment results in Figure 10 and Figure 11. Our findings indicate that alignment sensitivity not only
depends on the metric used to compute it but also varies according to the specific tasks on which the vision models are
trained.

C. Experiments on Evaluating Alignment and Convergence
To demonstrate representational convergence, we take off-the-shelf models at multiple scales and multiple modalities and
measure their representational alignment.
C.1. Vision-Vision Alignment and Representation Quality
We consider 78 vision models in total:
• 17 ViT models ranging from ViT-tiny to ViT-giant, trained on tasks including ImageNet-21k (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020)
classification, Masked Autoencoders (He et al., 2021), DINO (Caron et al., 2021), and CLIP (Radford et al., 2021),
including some finetuned on ImageNet-12k.
• 1 randomly initialized ResNet-50.
• 11 ResNet-50 models trained with contrastive learning on ImageNet-1k, Places-365 (Zhou et al., 2017; López-Cifuentes
et al., 2020), and 9 synthetic image datasets used in Baradad et al. (2022).
• 49 ResNet-18 models trained with Alignment and Uniformity contrastive loss (Wang & Isola, 2020) on ImageNet-100,
Places-365, and 47 realistic and synthetic image datasets from Baradad et al. (2021).
To test representation quality, we evaluate linear probing performance on all 19 VTAB classification tasks (Zhai et al., 2019),
which is a standard multi-task transfer learning benchmark containing structured, specialized, and natural datasets covering
diverse domains. To reduce compute requirements, we subsample training and validation datasets to have at most 10,000
samples. We consider a representation solves a task if its performance is ≥ 80% of the best performance on that task across
all 78 models.
To compute the alignment metric, we use k = 10 nearest neighbors over 1000 image representations computed on Places365’s validation dataset (Zhou et al., 2017). This dataset is disjoint from VTAB datasets, although both contain natural
images.
C.2. Cross-Modal Alignment
We compare the representation of an image in a vision model to the representation of a caption describing that image in a
language model. The language model families we consider are BLOOM (BigScience et al., 2022), OpenLLaMA (Geng & Liu,
2023), and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023). For Figure 4, we included more recent model families such as OLMo (Groeneveld
et al., 2024), LLaMA3 (Meta, 2024), Gemma (Team et al., 2024), and Mistral/Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2023; 2024). These
models were downloaded from Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2019).
For vision models, we consider ViT models (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) of various sizes trained on various data and objectives.
We mainly consider the popular vision models: classification on ImageNet-21K (Russakovsky et al., 2015), MAE (He
et al., 2021), DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023), CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), and CLIP finetuned on ImageNet-12K. These
models were downloaded from PyTorch Image Models (TIMM; Wightman (2021)). This is a subset of the models used in
vision-vision comparison.
To compute the alignment metric, we use k = 10 nearest neighbors over 1024 samples from WIT (Wikipedia-based Image
Text)(Srinivasan et al., 2021). For the vision model, we use class token of each layer, and for the language model, we
average pool each layer to a single token. Since it is not trivial to determine where the alignment might occur, we draw
inspiration from BrainScore(Schrimpf et al., 2018) and compute pairwise alignment scores, then take the maximum. One of
these pairwise comparisons also includes concatenated features. We apply l2 normalization to the features before measuring
the distance. As transformer architectures have “emergent outliers” (Dettmers et al., 2022), we truncate the elements in the
features that are above the 95-th percentile.
Simply taking the last token did not show any strong alignment signal. We also experimented with prompting the language
model and taking the last token representation. The prompt we used was
An image with the caption ‘<caption>’. This is an image of a <fill>
Using prompting showed similar trends to average pooling but had slightly lower alignment scores.

Figure 12. Increasing caption density improves alignment: We vary caption length using the Densely-Captioned-Images (DCI)
dataset (Urbanek et al., 2023). Starting from a dense caption, we used LLaMA3-8B-Instruct (Meta, 2024) to summarize and generate
coarse-grained captions. We compute the average alignment score across all vision and language models with standard deviation
measured over the language models we evaluated. With denser captions, the mapping may become more bijective, leading to improved
language-vision alignment scores.

D. Color Cooccurrence Experiment
Here we describe the details of how we created the four color representations visualized in Fig. 6, from left to right.
Perceptual representation from CIELAB color space We embed pixels taken from the CIFAR-10 image dataset
(Krizhevsky et al., 2009; Torralba et al., 2008) based on the CIELAB color space, which is designed as a perceptually
uniform space that changes numerical values correspond to similar perceived changes in color.
Three representations from cooccurrence in VISION and LANGUAGE For these three representations, we first obtain
a dissimilarity matrix over colors (in different ways detailed below), then use multidimensional scaling (Shepard, 1980) to
find a 3-dimensional embedding in which Euclidean distance between the embeddings for A and B, zA and zB , best matches
this dissimilarity matrix. We use 1,000 fits and take the best match. Afterward, we visually align it with the CIELAB space
by finding the best rotation, translation, scaling, and flipping, by running the Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm (Kabsch, 1976;
1978; Umeyama, 1991) twice, once on z and once on −z, to account for flipping. The dissimilarity matrix we used in each
case is described as following:
• VISION: Pixel cooccurrence. We collect color cooccurrence statistics from the CIFAR-10 dataset, and estimate a
joint distribution p(A, B) over 300,000 randomly sampled pixel colors A and B that occur within a radius of at most 4
pixels of one another. Colors are quantized on a grid in RGB space and represented as discrete variables, and p(A, B)
is modeled as a table of normalized counts, from which we compute the empirical pointwise mutual information
matrix KPMI (A, B). Quantization ensures that there is no bias from how color distances are represented in RGB
space. Dissimilarity matrix is defined as −KPMI (A, B) + c, where c = maxA,B KPMI (A, B) is an offset to ensure
non-negativity (similar to the constant in Sec. 4.2 and Proposition G.1 that ensures neural networks can express KPMI ).
• LANGUAGE. We used an approach similar to Abdou et al. (2021).
– We take 20 pairs of (color, word) appeared in the dataset collected by Lindsey & Brown (2014), where 51
participants were asked to free name each of the 330 colors from the Munsell Color Chart. We filtered words that
appeared less than 100 times, and computed each word’s associate color by taking the centroid in CIELAB space.
Our filtering process followed Abdou et al. (2021) exactly, but resulted in 20 colors, a slightly different set than
the 18 colors they claimed.
– For each of the 20 color words <col>, we construct three sentences:
The color <col>.
This color is <col>.
The color of this thing is <col>.

radii proportional to the size of the model, and color-coded by their rank order in language modeling scores (1 − bits-per-byte). We
observe an “emergence”-esque trend on GSM8K performance as the alignment score increases.

and obtain the average sentence embedding from the language encoder, as the embedding for <col> (details
below). We find this approach more effective than Abdou et al. (2021), which uses object names that potentially
have color biases, even though the objects may appear in multiple colors.
– Unlike Abdou et al. (2021), we did not perform linear regression from language embedding to CIELAB space,
which distorts distances and easily overfits with only 20 samples. Instead, we used multidimensional scaling to
best preserve distances, as described above.
– Masked language contrastive learning (SimCSE) embedding: We used sentence embedding from the
unsupervised SimCSE RoBERTa-L (Gao et al., 2021) to encode the above sentences into 1024-dimensional
embeddings, and used the pairwise Euclidean distances among <col> embeddings as the dissimilarity matrix.
– Masked language predictive learning (RoBERTa) embedding: We concatenated hidden states of the last four
layers of RoBERTa-L (Liu et al., 2019), following (Devlin et al., 2018). We averaged across token dimensions,
and obtained a 4096-dimensional embedding for each of the above sentences, and used the pairwise Euclidean
distances among <col> embeddings as the dissimilarity matrix.

E. Caption Density Experiments
We use LLaMA3-8B-Instruct (Meta, 2024) to generate summary captions at various densities for images in the Densely
Captioned Images dataset (Urbanek et al., 2023) from the train split. Following Urbanek et al. (2023), we prompt the
language model with the following instructions to generate captions at differing granularity:
system: You are given a full-text description of an image. You should summarize it into about
<num_words> words, being sure to include as much salient visual information as possible given the
<num_words> word constraint, especially information from the start of the original description. The
new description should apply for the original image. Respond with only the summary, in one line.
user: <original_caption>
We measure the alignment with this generated caption to test our hypothesis that denser captations would result in higher
alignment scores. In Figure 12, we find that the alignment score also improves as caption length increases.

F. Additional Results on Downstream Task Predictivity
We report additional results on testing whether alignment predicts downstream performance. In Figure 13, we plot the
vision-language alignment score against GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) performance. GSM8K is a dataset of grade school
math questions used to evaluate LLM downstream performance. Similar to Hellaswag, as models become more aligned,
their performance on GSM8K also improves.

G. Analysis of Contrastive Learners
G.1. Contrastive objectives learn pointwise mutual information
There are two widely used forms of contrastive objectives. We now discuss each form in details and show how they both are
minimized by the pointwise mutual information (PMI) as stated in Eq. (5). To simplify notation, we consider learning the
bivariate model g(xa , xb ) ∈ R. In Sec. 4, such g is optimized within the family of {g = ⟨fX , fX ⟩ : fX ∈ FX }.
Recall that our positive pairs are sampled from (x, x+ ) ∼ Pcoor , and that the negative pairs are sampled independently from
P
i.i.d.
its marginals which we denote as (x, x− ) ∼ P where P (x) = x+ Pcoor (x, x+ ).
1. The binary NCE loss (Gutmann & Hyvärinen, 2010) is defined with a certain prior over sampling positive vs. negative
pairs. Let ppos be the probability of sampling a positive pair. Then the loss is given by
Lbinary-NCE (g) ≜ ppos · E(x,x+ )∼Pcoor [− log σ(g(x, x+ ))] + (1 − ppos ) · E

= KPMI (xa , xb ) + cX (xa ).

(27)
(28)

(29)
(30)

For the general τ ̸= 1 case, we have g (and corresponding fX ) recovers KPMI up to an offset and a scale. Our main
argument in Sec. 4 that fX recovers KPMI still holds.
G.2. Contrastive learners can represent KPMI exactly under smoothness conditions
We want to express KPMI + C using some representation function fX : X → Rn so that
⟨fX (xa ), fX (xb )⟩ = KPMI (xa , xb ) + C,

for some C.

(31)

For such an fX to exist, an equivalent criterion is that KPMI + C is positive semi-definite (PSD), as can be seen from
eigendecomposition.
25

The Platonic Representation Hypothesis

Proposition G.1. Suppose that the off-diagonal elements of KPMI are bounded within [log ρmin , log ρmin + δ] ∈ (−∞, 0].
We have KPMI + C is positive semi-definite (PSD) for some C if the joint distribution is sufficiently smooth:
Pcoor (zi | zi )
≥ eN δ ρmin ,
∀i.
(32)
Pcoor (zi )
Proof. Note that KPMI + C still only has non-positive off-diagonal elements if
−C ≥ log ρmin + δ.

(33)

For such C, it is diagonally dominant (and thus PSD) if,
X
X
∀i,
KPMI (zi , zi ) + C ≥
|KPMI (zi , zj ) + C| = −(N − 1)C −

(34)

j̸=i

or equivalently,
∀i,

KPMI (zi , zj ) ≥ 0.

(35)

The following choice of C readily satisfies the above Eq. (35):
1 X
KPMI (zi , zj ).
C ≜ − min

j

(36)

Therefore, it remains to show that Eq. (33) is true. Note that

KPMI (zi , zj ) ≥
log ρmin + (min KPMI (zi , zi )).
−C ≜ min

(37)

Therefore, it suffices to have

N −1

(38)

Pcoor (zi | zi )
≥ eN δ ρmin ,
Pcoor (zi )

(39)

Rearranging terms gives the desired condition
∀i.

Remark G.2. Proposition G.1 is one example that a sufficiently smooth world or a sufficiently high sampling rate allows the
PMI kernel KPMI to be exactly represented as inner products of a learned feature space (up to a scale). The condition here
can be satisfied, for example, if the off-diagonal terms decay linearly with respect to N and stay sufficiently close to each
other. While the condition is somewhat strict, it captures the essence that smoothness and continuity allow easier learning.
Nonetheless, we note that exact representation is not necessary for convergence, and thus this requirement can likely be
relaxed. Please see Sec. 6 for discussions on practical settings.
